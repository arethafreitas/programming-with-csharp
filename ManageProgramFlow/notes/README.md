## The Task Parallel library

You can think of a task as an abstraction of a unit work to be performed. The **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** provides a range of resources that allow you to use tasks in a application. The *Task.Parallel* class in the library provides three methods that can be used to create applications that contain tasks that execute in parallel.
